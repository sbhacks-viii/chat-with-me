## Inspiration
Initially, we struggled to collaborate together as a team as we had no direct way to communicate with each other. Then, we asked ourselves, "What if there was a way we could message each other virtually?" The question became a mission, and we're proud to present Chat With Me, a messaging web app for passionate individuals looking to streamline their creativity.
## What it does
Chat With Me provides a simple, sleek user interface for busybodies to message their friends, families, and coworkers without the hassle of meeting in person. Users can join a chatroom.
## How we built it
Chat with Me was built with ReactJS, GraphQL, and Node.js. 
## Challenges we ran into
This was our first time using ReactJS, GraphQL, and Node.js, so it was challenge to learn these new technologies. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
In the end, we're proud of our final product and of the time and effort we spent to create it. It's not every day you can look at something and say "Hey, I made that."
## What we learned
The creation of Chat With Me not only taught us the technical prowess necessary to develop a web app but also the importance of friendship, family, and the virtues of hard work and perseverance. 
## What's next for Chat With Me
There's always room for improvement and Chat With Me is no different. We hope to add more features and improve the functionality of our design to support a more comfortable messaging interface for our users.
